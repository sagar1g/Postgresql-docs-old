How to optimize slow queries in PostgreSQL
=============================
Optimizing slow queries in PostgreSQL is a critical aspect of improving database performance. Here are several tips and recommendations to help you optimize slow queries effectively:
 
Step 1) Enable Slow Query Logging in PostgreSQL config file.
 
log_min_duration_statement = 5000 # Log queries that take longer than 5000ms (5 seconds)
log_line_prefix = '%m %p %q%u@%d '
 
Step 2) Analyze Query Execution Plan 
 
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM emp2024 WHERE dno = 10 ORDER BY esal DESC LIMIT 10;
 
Example of the output:
 
Limit (cost=16.34..16.42 rows=10 width=50) (actual time=0.123..0.156 rows=10 loops=1)
 -> Index Scan using idx_emp2024_dno on emp2024 (cost=0.42..16.31 rows=500 width=50) (actual time=0.022..0.053 rows=500 loops=1)
 Index Cond: (dno = 10)
Planning Time: 1.032 ms
Execution Time: 0.202 ms
 
Key points to note:
 
Index Scan: This indicates that an index is being used, which is good for performance.
Cost: The planner’s estimate of the query execution cost.
Actual Time: The actual time spent on execution.
 
Step 3) Optimizing Based on the Execution Plan.
 
CREATE INDEX idx_emp2024_department_esal ON emp2024(dno, esal DESC);
 
Step 4) Rewrite the Query 
 
SELECT employee_id, name, esal FROM emp2024 WHERE dno = 10 ORDER BY esal DESC LIMIT 10;
 
Step 5) Use LIMIT Early in Subqueries
 
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM emp2024 WHERE dno = 10 LIMIT 100) AS subquery 
ORDER BY esal DESC LIMIT 10;
 
Step 6) Vacuum and Analyze the Database 
 
VACUUM ANALYZE;
 
Step 7) Optimize PostgreSQL Configuration 
 
work_mem: Controls the amount of memory used by operations like sorting and hashing. 

work_mem = (Total RAM * 1% to 2% of available RAM) / Max Expected Concurrent Queries

shared_buffers: The amount of memory PostgreSQL uses for caching data. Increase for large sorts/hashes. Set this to 20-35% of available RAM. 
 
effective_cache_size: This setting provides an estimate of how much memory is available for caching data, including the memory used by the OS and other processes. It doesn’t allocate memory directly but influences query planning for index scans. Set to 50-75% of RAM.

Step 8) Partitioning large tables to reduce query time.
 
Step 9) Avoid Locks - Use FOR UPDATE and FOR SHARE to avoid deadlocks and minimize long transactions.
 
Step 10) Use Connection Pooling to manage DB connections efficiently.
 
Step 11) Materialized Views - Cache complex query results with materialized views
 
Step 12) Monitor slow queries using pg_stat_activity view or pg_stat_statements extension:
 
Step 13) Leverage Parallel Queries - Enable parallel query execution for large queries.
 
Step 14) Use read replicas to offload read-heavy queries.
 
Step 15) Log temp file usage (log_temp_files = 0) for optimization.
 
By following these short-hand tips, you can identify and fix the performance issues in PostgreSQL queries effectively.
