🚀 🚀 PostgreSQL Performance Tuning – My Proven Checklist for Real-World Optimization 🚀 💻 🖥️ 

Managing mission-critical PostgreSQL databases, I regularly tackle performance bottlenecks that can severely impact system reliability and user experience, from slow-running queries that affect SLAs to table bloat consuming unnecessary disk space, and underutilized hardware in high-load systems. 
💡 Over the years, I’ve developed a reliable, hands-on performance checklist that consistently enhances speed, efficiency, and stability in production PostgreSQL environments. Whether you're optimizing a legacy system or scaling a modern application, this compact guide offers practical tuning tips you can apply right away.

1️⃣ Analyze Every Query Like a Detective.

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'abc@example.com';

🔍 Look for:
Sequential Scans (replace with indexes)
High cost estimates
Row misestimates
Nested Loops on large datasets
✅ Tip: Always test query plans after each change to verify improvements.

2️⃣ Index Wisely – Not Blindly

Proper indexing is the backbone of performance, but over-indexing can hurt write performance and consume space.

🔹 Use:
B-TREE for equality, range filters
GIN for JSONB, full-text search
BRIN for very large, append-only tables

3️⃣ Tune Core Settings (postgresql.conf)

Out-of-the-box settings are too conservative for most production systems

Recommended parameters:
👉 shared_buffers → 25–40% of RAM ✅ 
👉 work_mem → 4–16MB per operation (depends on concurrency) 
👉 effective_cache_size → 50–75% of RAM
👉 maintenance_work_mem → 64–256MB for VACUUM, CREATE INDEX
👉 max_parallel_workers → at least 4
🔧 Use PGTune or Percona PGConfig to auto-calculate these based on your server specs.

4️⃣ Watch Autovacuum Closely – Don’t Let Bloat Win

Autovacuum is critical for reclaiming space and maintaining stats. Tune it based on write patterns.

👉 autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 50
👉 autovacuum_analyze_threshold = 50
👉 autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.05
👉 autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.02

🔍 Check table bloat:

SELECT relname, n_dead_tup 
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC 
LIMIT 10;

5️⃣ Monitor Like a Pro
Performance optimization is incomplete without monitoring.

🧠 Enable and use:
pg_stat_statements – Top slow queries
pg_stat_activity – Active queries and sessions
pg_stat_io – Disk I/O per relation (PostgreSQL 16+)
pg_stat_user_indexes – Index usage

🏁 Final Thoughts
PostgreSQL is incredibly powerful, but real performance comes from
Smart query design
Strategic indexing
Thoughtful configuration tuning
Proactive monitoring and vacuuming
