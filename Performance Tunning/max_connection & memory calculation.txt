How to Calculate PostgreSQL Max Connections Based on CPU, Memory, and Other Factors üßÆüîç

Configuring the right value for max_connections in PostgreSQL is crucial for performance. Setting it too high wastes resources, while setting it too low limits concurrency. Here‚Äôs how to calculate the optimal max_connections based on CPU, memory, and workload.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Formula to Calculate max_connectionsA general formula based on available memory:

max_connections = (Total Available Memory for Connections) / (Memory Per Connection)

Where:

Total Available Memory for Connections = Total RAM - (OS Memory + PostgreSQL Shared Buffers + Other Background Processes)

Memory Per Connection = work_mem + temp_buffers + overhead

2Ô∏è‚É£ Consider Key System Resources

üñ•Ô∏è CPU Cores:

Each active connection consumes CPU cycles.

A higher number of CPU cores allows for higher concurrency.

General best practice:

Single-core systems: Keep max_connections < 100

4+ core systems: Can handle max_connections 200-500

High-end DB servers: Use connection pooling (PgBouncer)

üí≤ RAM (Memory Calculation Example):Assume Total RAM = 16GBOS & Background services consume ~4GBPostgreSQL Shared Buffers (25% of RAM) = 4GBWork Memory Per Connection (work_mem) = 4MB

max_connections = (16GB - (4GB + 4GB)) / 4MB = 8GB / 4MB = 2000

üí° However, allowing 2000 connections is unrealistic!Use connection pooling (PgBouncer) to efficiently manage connections and reduce overhead.

By balancing these factors, you can fine-tune max_connections to match your system‚Äôs capabilities and workload needs, ensuring optimal performance without overloading resources.
