Routine Database Maintenance Tasks in PostgreSQL"
As a PostgreSQL Database Administrator, keeping the database in optimal condition requires regular maintenance. Here are key tasks you should focus on:
üîπ "Routine Vacuuming"
PostgreSQL uses MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control), meaning dead tuples accumulate over time. VACUUM helps reclaim storage and maintain performance.
1Ô∏è‚É£ "Vacuuming Basics"
 VACUUM removes dead tuples, but space isn't immediately reclaimed for the OS.
 VACUUM FULL compacts and returns space but requires a table lock.
 
2Ô∏è‚É£ "Recovering Disk Space"
 Dead tuples from UPDATE & DELETE remain until vacuumed.
 Autovacuum helps, but VACUUM FULL or pg_repack is needed for aggressive cleanup.
 
 
3Ô∏è‚É£ "Updating Planner Statistics"
 ANALYZE updates statistics for the query planner, improving execution plans.
 Running VACUUM ANALYZE after bulk inserts/updates ensures better performance.
 
 
4Ô∏è‚É£ "Updating the Visibility Map"
 PostgreSQL maintains a visibility map to track which pages don‚Äôt need vacuuming.
 Helps Index-Only Scans and improves autovacuum efficiency.
 
 
5Ô∏è‚É£ "Preventing Transaction ID Wraparound Failures"
 Every transaction gets a transaction ID (XID), which has a limit (~2 billion).
 Running VACUUM FREEZE prevents wraparound failures and data corruption.
 
 
6Ô∏è‚É£ "The Autovacuum Daemon"
 Automates vacuuming based on system load and table activity.
 Tune autovacuum settings (e.g., autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit) for better performance.
 
üîπ "Routine Reindexing"
 Indexes can bloat over time, degrading performance. Use:
 REINDEX TABLE to rebuild specific indexes.
 REINDEX DATABASE to rebuild all indexes.
 Consider pg_repack for index maintenance without downtime.
 
 
üîπ "Log File Maintenance"
 Database logs are critical but can grow large. Best practices:
 Rotate logs using PostgreSQL‚Äôs log_rotation_size and log_rotation_age.
 Archive logs periodically to free disk space.
 Monitor logs to detect slow queries, errors, and security threats.
