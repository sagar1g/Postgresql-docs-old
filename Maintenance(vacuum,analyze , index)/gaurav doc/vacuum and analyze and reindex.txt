1. VACUUM

Think of it as cleaning up garbage.

When you update or delete rows, the old versions donâ€™t get removed immediately (Postgres keeps them for safety).

VACUUM removes these dead rows and frees space so the table doesnâ€™t grow unnecessarily.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Like cleaning unused files from your computer so it doesnâ€™t get slow.


VACUUM = cleanup & reuse space internally (no file shrink).

VACUUM FULL = cleanup + shrink file by rewriting table (but blocks access).


2. ANALYZE

Think of it as collecting statistics.

PostgreSQL needs to know how much data is in each table/column to make smart decisions on how to run queries faster.

ANALYZE updates this info.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Like telling Google Maps the latest traffic conditions so it can choose the fastest route.

3. REINDEX

Think of it as repairing or rebuilding indexes.

Indexes are like a bookâ€™s index â€“ they help you find rows quickly.

Over time, indexes can get bloated or corrupted. REINDEX rebuilds them fresh.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Like re-organizing a messy library catalog so you can find books faster.

âœ… In short:

VACUUM = clean junk

ANALYZE = update statistics

REINDEX = rebuild indexes for faster search
