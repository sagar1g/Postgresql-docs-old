The issue you're experiencing stems from corruption in the pg_attribute catalog, likely exacerbated by transaction ID (XID) wraparound in your database. Here’s a breakdown of the steps to resolve this:

1. Root Cause Analysis
Corruption in pg_attribute: The system catalog pg_attribute is essential for PostgreSQL’s operation. Errors like "cache lookup failed for relation" suggest corruption in this table.
XID Wraparound Risks: Databases must perform regular vacuuming to prevent transaction ID wraparound. Your logs show transaction ages exceeding autovacuum_freeze_max_age.
2. Steps to Mitigate
(a) Immediate Resolution (Post-Corruption Detection)
Since pg_attribute is a system catalog, direct modifications are restricted, and operations like VACUUM or REINDEX may fail due to the corruption. Attempt these steps:

Start PostgreSQL in Single-User Mode:
postgres --single -D /data/patroni HES

Check and Fix pg_attribute XID: Update relfrozenxid for pg_attribute to a safe value:

SELECT oid, relname, relfrozenxid FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'pg_attribute';

UPDATE pg_class SET relfrozenxid = (SELECT datfrozenxid FROM pg_database WHERE datname = 'HES')
WHERE oid = <pg_attribute_oid>;
Replace <pg_attribute_oid> with the actual OID retrieved.

Attempt Vacuum Again:
VACUUM FREEZE pg_catalog.pg_attribute;

(b) Restore Backup
If the corruption persists and is irrecoverable, restoring a clean backup is necessary:

Stop PostgreSQL and Restore Backup:

Use pg_basebackup or another consistent backup tool.
Ensure the restored data doesn’t include the corrupted catalog entries.
Ensure Replication Slots are Cleaned:

List stale replication slots:
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;

Drop unused slots:
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('<slot_name>');

(c) Prevent Future Issues
Increase autovacuum Parameters:

Ensure that autovacuum processes keep up with XID usage:

SET autovacuum_work_mem = '1GB';  -- Adjust based on available memory
SET maintenance_work_mem = '2GB';
Increase autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit for faster vacuums:
SET autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 2000000000;  -- Example value
Schedule Regular Vacuum: Run regular database-wide VACUUM operations, particularly before reaching autovacuum_freeze_max_age.

3. Follow-Up Post-Restoration
Verify Data Consistency:

SELECT datname, age(datfrozenxid) FROM pg_database;
Ensure no database is close to the autovacuum_freeze_max_age.

Resolve Pending Transactions:
SELECT * FROM pg_prepared_xacts;
Commit or rollback any lingering prepared transactions.

Ensure System Stability: After restoration, monitor replication, autovacuum logs, and system catalog health to avoid recurrence.
