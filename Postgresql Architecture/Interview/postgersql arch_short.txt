overview of PostgreSQL architecture:

1. Client: Applications or users connect to PostgreSQL using a client library or tool (e.g., psql, pgAdmin).

2. Server: The PostgreSQL server accepts connections, processes queries, and manages data. It consists of:
    - Postmaster: The main server process that coordinates activities.
    - Backend: Separate processes that handle individual client connections (one per client).

3. Database: A collection of schemas, tables, and data.
    - Schemas: Logical groupings of tables and objects (like a namespace).
    - Tables: Storage structures for data.
    - Indexes: Data structures that improve query performance.

4. Storage:
    - Data Files: Store actual data (rows) in tables.
    - WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) Files: Record changes (transactions) for data integrity and recovery.
    - Configuration Files: Store server settings and parameters.

5. Memory:
    - Shared Buffer Cache: A memory area that stores frequently accessed data.
    - WAL Buffer: A memory area that stores transaction log records.

6. Processes:
    - Background Worker: Performs tasks like vacuuming, statistics collection, and auto-vacuum.
    - Lock Manager: Manages concurrency and locking for data access.
