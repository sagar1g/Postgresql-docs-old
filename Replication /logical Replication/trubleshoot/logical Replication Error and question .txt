Q1.i have logical replication goning on server then how i will excute create table command:-

Step 1: Run CREATE TABLE on Publisher

-- On primary/publisher
CREATE TABLE sales_data (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name text,
    purchase_date date,
    amount numeric
);

Step 2: Run Same CREATE TABLE on Subscriber

-- On replica/subscriber
CREATE TABLE sales_data (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name text,
    purchase_date date,
    amount numeric
);

Step 2:
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION subscription_name REFRESH PUBLICATION;

‚úÖ When to Use REFRESH PUBLICATION

Use it when:

You‚Äôve added new tables to the publication using:

ALTER PUBLICATION my_publication ADD TABLE new_table;


But those new tables aren‚Äôt automatically picked up by the subscription.

And you want to sync structure and start replicating those new tables without recreating the subscription.


Q2:- Replication slot failed Resaon

:- 

üîç Common Reasons Why a Replication Slot Fails
1. Subscriber Down / Stopped

The logical subscriber server is stopped, crashed, or not running.

The slot remains on publisher but is inactive = false.

2. Network / Connectivity Issue

Network link between publisher and subscriber broken.

Firewalls, SSL certificate expiry, or DNS issues stop replication.

3. Subscription Disabled or Dropped

Someone ran:

ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub_name DISABLE;


Or subscription dropped without dropping the slot.

The slot is left behind but never consumed.

4. Schema or Data Apply Error on Subscriber

Subscriber encounters error applying changes (e.g. missing column, constraint violation).

Apply worker crashes repeatedly ‚Üí slot stops advancing.

5. Old / Long Transaction on Subscriber

If subscriber has a long-running transaction, it may not confirm flush LSN.

Publisher WAL retention grows because slot is waiting.

6. Resource Issues on Subscriber

Subscriber out of disk space, memory, or CPU ‚Üí apply worker fails.

Replication halts ‚Üí slot inactive.

7. Misconfigured Replication

Publisher and subscriber versions not compatible.

Publication/subscription misaligned (e.g. wrong tables).

Apply worker cannot keep up.

8. Manual Intervention

Slot may be manually marked inactive or left behind if subscriber dropped incorrectly.

‚úÖ How to Diagnose

On Publisher:

SELECT slot_name, active, restart_lsn, confirmed_flush_lsn
FROM pg_replication_slots;


If active = false ‚Üí slot is not being used by subscriber.

If restart_lsn not moving ‚Üí subscriber stuck.

On Subscriber:

SELECT * FROM pg_stat_subscription;


Check if subscription is enabled.

Look at last_error field (in recent versions) for the exact reason.

üëâ In simple words:
Replication slot fails when subscriber is not reading WAL.
This can be due to subscriber down, network issues, subscription disabled, apply errors, or resource problems.
