
Synchronous Replication in PostgreSQL 16

Implementing synchronous replication in PostgreSQL ensures that each write transaction is confirmed on both the primary and a designated synchronous standby server before it is considered complete. 
This setup enhances data durability and consistency at the cost of increased commit latency. Below is a step-by-step guide on setting up synchronous replication in PostgreSQL 16.

1.master server: -
postgresql.conf

    wal_level = replica
    max_wal_senders = 5
    synchronous_commit = on
    synchronous_standby_names = 'FIRST 1 (sync_standby_1)'
	 hot_standby = on.
	 
2.Create a Base Backup:

pg_basebackup -h primary_ip -D /path/to/standby/data/dir -U replicator -Fp -Xs -P -R
