       last_analyze,
       last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_all_tables
WHERE relname = 'your_table_name';
ðŸ‘‰ Explanation:

last_analyze â†’ shows the timestamp of the last manual ANALYZE.

last_autoanalyze â†’ shows the timestamp of the last auto ANALYZE.


3. If you want to check for all tables in a schema:

SELECT schemaname,
       relname,
       last_analyze,
       last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_all_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'your_schema_name'
ORDER BY last_analyze DESC NULLS LAST;

4. If you want to see the last VACUUM and ANALYZE times for all tables in your PostgreSQL database, you can run:

SELECT schemaname,
       relname,
       last_vacuum,
       last_autovacuum,
       last_analyze,
       last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_all_tables
ORDER BY schemaname, relname;


ðŸ‘‰ Columns explained:

last_vacuum â†’ last time manual VACUUM was run

last_autovacuum â†’ last time autovacuum ran

last_analyze â†’ last time manual ANALYZE was run

last_autoanalyze â†’ last time auto ANALYZE ran

This will list all tables across all schemas in your database.
