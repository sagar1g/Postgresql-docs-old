With PostgreSQL 17, there’s no need to grant full SUPERUSER privileges just for routine maintenance tasks.

You can now delegate key operations like:

 VACUUM
 ANALYZE
 REINDEX
 REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW
 CLUSTER
 LOCK TABLE

…using the new MAINTAIN privilege.

𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗠𝗔𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗔𝗜𝗡 𝗼𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲:
GRANT MAINTAIN ON TABLE your_table TO maintenance_user;

GRANT pg_maintain TO maintenance_user;

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀:
 Improves security by avoiding unnecessary superuser rights
 Provides precise access control
 Simplifies maintenance without compromising safety

Keep your PostgreSQL environment optimized with the principle of least privilege in mind.
